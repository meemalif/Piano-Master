# Piano-Master
Piano tile game using python and pygame.
Open piano typing master.py and run the program.
The game is made by pygame library.
I hav included 4 piano keys by the name of k1music etc which will be played whenever user clicks on any tile.
Whenever the user click on tile block the block will be respawned at random negative (-500 to -100) y-asix.
if the block crosses the end line (height of window screen) the game will end with a buzzer sound.
